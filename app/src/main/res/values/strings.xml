    <string name="payment1">
        We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and other credit and debit cards to process transactions and payments securely through our third-party integration. You agree to pay for all services you authorise and accept that you will be charged using your payment method for any amounts accrued by or in connection with your account.
 \nWe use third-party services and integrations for enhanced security and protection, which means processing fees, service fees, usage fees, and transaction fees may be applied to your bookings, refunds, and payment withdrawals. Such fees are subject to change to secure, protect, develop, and provide our users with the best products, features, and services. Our third-party providers maintain security, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect your personal data against unauthorised access, destruction, loss, alteration, or misuse. Therefore, we may update our booking and payment processes, fees, and prices periodically to ensure we can operate and deliver services safely and securely to all users. Moreover, we may restrict bookings and quantities at any time to ensure fair and legitimate usage, as well as for validity and compliance with third-party services, companies, promoters, partners, venues, and organisations. You must complete the payment set up process in the active session to securely activate and protect your account with our third-party service. Otherwise, you will have to go through the full payment set up and authentication process again.
 \nYour personal data is accessible only to a limited number of personnel who require it to perform their duties, and authorisation measures are in place for accessing such data. While no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we apply strict measures to ensure good security and protection. We also perform regular maintenance and testing to maintain high security standards and procedures to safeguard your data. In the event of fraudulent or suspicious activities, we aim to process your request in a timely and orderly manner, carrying out further checks for verification purposes to resolve any issues. We believe this approach ensures your data is adequately managed, and reasonable efforts are made to provide security appropriate to the risks associated with data processing. For bookings and cancellations: if an event you have booked is cancelled, we will honour refunds, though fees may be non-refundable. Refunds will be assessed on a case- by-case basis because, each time a transaction is processed, fees are mandatory to facilitate payment and operate our services. We will do our best to honour users wishes for continuing to use and support our products and services.

We aim to process all withdrawal requests within 14 days. Withdrawals are subject to a 2.5% processing fee, provided that all bookings and payments have been successfully cleared and securely verified. However, withdrawal requests cannot be made until the event(s) associated with your account have concluded, and all bookings have been validated. If any booking or transaction is flagged as suspicious or fraudulent, funds may be held indefinitely pending an investigation. Please note that there is no fixed timeframe for resolving withdrawal disputes, as these are managed by our third-party provider, and while we will help and support, we do not handle payment processing directly.</string>
